<h2>Beyond NEHR: Supporting National Health Initiatives</h2>
<p>The HIB will also provide the legal basis to enable sharing of health
information to facilitate shared care and coordination across different
settings and between healthcare institutions and community partners. While
the sharing of such information has benefits such as supporting outreach
for national programmes (e.g. Healthier SG and Age Well SG) and better
care quality, we recognise the potential risks of exposure should there
be any unauthorised use.</p>
<p>Therefore, the HIB will also&nbsp;<strong>introduce safeguards</strong>&nbsp;<strong>to ensure proper governance, cybersecurity and data security</strong>.</p>
<p>A key safeguard is that the HIB enables&nbsp;<strong>sharing of health information only if it fulfils these requirements:</strong>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The parties who are permitted to share and receive your health information
must be listed in the HIB</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The specific use case for data sharing must be listed in the HIB</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only the specific data types that are prescribed under the HIB can be
shared and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your health information can be shared only for the use case listed in
the HIB</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>MOH will also be able to stop any further unauthorised sharing of health
information.</p>
