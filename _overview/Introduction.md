<h2>Objectives of the Health Information Bill (HIB)</h2>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HIB will require all licensed healthcare
providers, including private clinics, clinical laboratories and radiological
services, to contribute selected health information to NEHR. These providers
will also be granted access to NEHR to support better care continuity and
safeguard patient welfare.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HIB will also enable and regulate the sharing
of non-NEHR individually identifiable health information within the healthcare
ecosystem in support of national health programmes and initiatives.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; To ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of
health information, the HIB will set out cybersecurity and data security
standards for healthcare providers and Health Information Management Systems
(HIMS).</p>
