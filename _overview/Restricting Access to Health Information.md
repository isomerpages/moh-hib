<h1>Can I refuse access to or sharing of my NEHR records?</h1>
<p>If you do not want any healthcare professional to access your health record, <strong>you can choose to restrict access to your NEHR records</strong>.
Once access is restricted, <strong>healthcare professionals must not access your NEHR records even for care purposes</strong>.
You can already restrict such access to NEHR records today by opting out
of the NEHR.</p>
<p>Under the proposed HIB in future, a healthcare professional may <strong>choose to override the access restriction</strong> to
provide you with life-saving treatment <strong>during a medical emergency</strong>.
In such a scenario, the healthcare professional <strong>must first assess whether you face an immediate and serious threat to life or risk of severe, irreversible harm unless medical intervention is provided</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>MOH will audit cases where your access restriction is overridden</strong> by
the healthcare professional. Healthcare professionals who inappropriately
override access restrictions to NEHR records may be subject to legal penalties
under the HIB and disciplinary action from the respective professional
bodies, such as the Singapore Medical Council.</p>
<h1>What happens after I exercise my access restriction rights?</h1>
<p>While healthcare professionals will be blocked from accessing your NEHR
records, the background <strong>contribution of selected health information to NEHR will continue</strong>.
This ensures that there will be <strong>no gaps in your NEHR record</strong> if
you choose to remove the access restriction in future.</p>
<p>The ability to place access restrictions on your NEHR records is <strong>intended to uphold your autonomy and privacy</strong>.
If you restrict access to your NEHR records, your doctor will not be able
to access them for your care needs.</p>
<p>Today, you can already check the NEHR Access History in HealthHub, to
see if your NEHR records have been accessed.</p>
<p>If you wish to restrict access, more details on the opt-out process is
available in <a href="https://www.synapxe.sg/healthtech/national-programmes/national-electronic-health-record-nehr/faq" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">the FAQs by Synapxe</a>.</p>
