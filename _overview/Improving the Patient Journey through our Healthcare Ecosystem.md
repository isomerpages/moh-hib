<p>• Access to NEHR records only for the provision of healthcare service
and community health service</p>

<p>• Access to NEHR records not allowed for</p>
<p>o Any employment purpose (except for statutory medical examinations prescribed
under the HIA); or</p>
<p>o Assessment of insurability.</p>
<p>• MOH has developed a set of guidelines to guide healthcare professionals
on the appropriate use and access to NEHR records.</p>
<p>• MOH has also built in technical controls such as session timeout after
a period of inactivity, and controls to limit patient search.</p>
<p>• Regular backend audits are performed to flag inappropriate accesses
for review and dormant accounts will be removed.</p>
