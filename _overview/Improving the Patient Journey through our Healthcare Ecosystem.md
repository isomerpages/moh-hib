<h2>Improving the patient journey through our healthcare ecosystem</h2>
<p>“…<em>better flow of patients’ data drives higher quality of care</em>”
– Minister Ong at World Organisation of Family Doctors Asia Pacific Regional
Conference 2024</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As our population ages, medical conditions become more complex, and seeing
a single doctor (whether public or private) may no longer be enough.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Patients may need to be referred to various specialists to manage different
medical conditions. Or they may need access to additional services like
health screening, rehabilitation, or physiotherapy.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Whether patients are seeing their family doctor, a specialist, or a surgeon
for the first time, when healthcare providers can immediately access patients'
medical history, drug allergies, and recent diagnostic images, they can
make better and faster decisions about patients’ treatment.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To do this, the healthcare system must be able to coordinate across these
different touchpoints seamlessly to deliver a higher quality of care for
patients. This requires patients' health information from previous visits
to be collected, stored, and shared for doctors and healthcare providers.</p>
