<h2>What the HIA Means for Patients</h2>
<p>• Rapidly ageing population + higher life expectancy = growing healthcare
needs; more chronic diseases requiring sustained care</p>
<p>• Healthcare delivery extends beyond hospitals to clinics, community partners,
caregivers. If care is shifting from hospitals to community, so must other

(HIA) is developed to improve the current situation of data collection
and sharing.</p>
