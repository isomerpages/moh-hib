<p>What the HIA Means For Patients</p>
<p>• Rapidly ageing population + higher life expectancy = growing healthcare
needs; more chronic diseases requiring sustained care</p>
<p>• Healthcare delivery extends beyond hospitals to clinics, community partners,
caregivers. If care is shifting from hospitals to community, so must other
