<h1>How we prevent improper access and use of your NEHR records</h1>
<p>Generally, <strong>only authorised healthcare professionals</strong> in
a healthcare organisation are allowed to access and use your NEHR records <strong>to provide care</strong> to
you. Therefore:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>A doctor <strong>cannot access your NEHR records for employment or insurance purposes</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unauthorised personnel in the same organisation, such as admin staff,
are not allowed to access your NEHR records.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Entities can be required to take corrective action</h1>
<p>The HIB will <strong>empower MOH to instruct healthcare providers to correct any non-compliances</strong>.
Corrective actions may include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Stopping unauthorised access and usage of NEHR records.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Destroying all health information collected in an authorised manner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stopping further unauthorised sharing of health information beyond the
data-sharing framework under the HIB.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Putting in measures to fulfil the cybersecurity and data security requirements.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>NEHR has safeguards to protect against cyber-attacks</h1>
<p>A comprehensive set of security measures and processes protect the NEHR
against cyberattacks. Both system and users’ access are periodically <strong>subjected to third-party audits</strong> to
ensure compliance with security standards for government-owned systems.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the HIB will require healthcare organisations to implement systems
that can connect to NEHR, a robust onboarding process is in place to ensure
such systems have met the appropriate connectivity and security requirements
before they are allowed to connect to NEHR.</p>
<h1>Baseline cybersecurity and data security measures</h1>
<p>Healthcare providers are <strong>required to meet cyber and data security measures</strong> if
they:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Have access to NEHR;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Need to contribute data to NEHR; OR</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Participate in data-sharing arrangements allowed under the HIB.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This <strong>ensures the safe and secure handling of health information</strong>.
Similar security requirements apply to any third-party vendor that the
healthcare provider engages to process health information under the HIB.
More details on the specific security measures can be found in the <a href="/files/MOH_Cir_No_85_2025_24Jan2025_Cyber_and_Data_Security_Guidelines_for_Healthcare_Providers_Annex_A.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Cyber and Data Security Guidelines for Healthcare Providers</a>.</p>
<p>MOH will also <strong>conduct random audits</strong> to ensure that healthcare
providers have fulfilled the security measures.</p>
<h1>What happens when a cybersecurity incident or data breach occurs?</h1>
<p>The HIB requires healthcare providers to <strong>report cybersecurity incidents or data breaches to MOH</strong>.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>An initial report of the confirmed cybersecurity incident or data breach
must be provided to MOH <strong>within 2 hours</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The detailed incident report must be submitted <strong>after 14 days</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The mandatory reporting of such incidents enables MOH to <strong>coordinate and respond to incidents that may adversely impact patient safety and privacy</strong>.
It also allows MOH to spot patterns that <strong>signal a larger-scale attack </strong>and<strong> pre-emptively take action to protect the integrity</strong> of
our healthcare system.</p>
<p>Healthcare providers are also required to<strong> notify the affected individuals in the event of a notifiable data breach</strong>.
Notifiable data breaches refer to data breaches involving more than 500
individuals*.</p>
<p>The HIB will not require healthcare providers to report data breaches
involving non-health information, such as the loss of only financial data
or account login details. However, they may still be required to report
such data breaches to PDPC if it meets the PDPA's data breach notification
criteria.</p>
<p><em>*The “500 individual” threshold is aligned with PDPA’s data breach notification criteria.</em>
