<h1>Public Consultation Report on the Health Information Bill</h1>
<p>The Ministry of Health conducted a public consultation from 11 December
2023 to 11 January 2024 to seek views on the proposed Health Information
Bill (HIB).</p>
<p>The HIB aims to establish a comprehensive framework for health information
governance, ensuring the safe and secure collection, access, use, and sharing
of health information by healthcare providers across various care settings
to support better care continuity and safeguard patient welfare. The Bill
focuses on (1) requiring contribution of and enabling access by healthcare
providers to health information in the National Electronic Health Record
(NEHR) system for better care continuity, (2) enabling health information
(outside of NEHR) sharing to support integrated care programmes like Healthier
SG and AgeWell SG, and (3) implementing essential cyber and data security
requirements to protect health information.</p>
<p>The feedback has been invaluable in shaping the Bill, and this report
summarises the key feedback received during the consultation period.&nbsp;
We thank all respondents for their thoughtful contributions to this important
piece of work that will transform Singapore's healthcare landscape.</p>
