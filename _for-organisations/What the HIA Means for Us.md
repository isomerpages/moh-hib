<h2>Organisational Roles and Responsibilities</h2>
<p>• Brief intro on how HIB would change the delivery of patient care</p>
<p>• Overview of how the regulatory requirements under the HIA will impact
business practices (if any) e.g. may need to onboard to NEHR if not already
onboarded, but no change if organisation already has an existing baseline
set of CS/DS requirements</p>
<h2>Responsibilities of the healthcare provider</h2>
<p>• Objective 1</p>
<p>o Timeline for onboarding to NEHR/mandatory contribution to NEHR/access
to NEHR by xxx . Link to Synapxe’s onboarding page</p>
<p>o MOH approval is required for entities’ access to NEHR.</p>
<p>o Entities should ensure that only the personnel who require NEHR access
for a HIA purpose are granted NEHR access.</p>
<p>o Entities should ensure access to NEHR is only for patients under entities’
care.</p>
<p>o Entities should notify Synapxe of any personnel movements that affect
NEHR access to ensure NEHR accounts are removed in a timely fashion (e.g.,
personnel has left organisation or changed role).</p>
<p>o Entity should educate their personnel on appropriate use of NEHR information
(e.g., by providing training, updating SOP).</p>
<p>o Entity should establish internal mechanisms to track and flag inappropriate
accesses.</p>
<p>• Objective 2</p>
<p>o Timeline for data sharing under the HIA by xxx</p>
<p>o Both discloser and recipient must abide by the conditions in the sharing
agreement.</p>
<p>o Recipient must ensure that the data is collected by only the authorised
personnel stated in the sharing agreement.</p>
<p>o Recipient must abide by the conditions in the sharing agreement when
using the data</p>
<p>• Objective 3</p>
<p>o Timeline for compliance with CS/DS requirements under the HIA by xxx.
Link to “Cyber and Data Security Guidebook” and “Implementation Support”
for help complying with the requirements.</p>
<p>o Designate an individual to ensure that they comply with cyber and data
security requirements for IT systems and medical devices under HIA</p>
<p>o Ensure that the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the health
information are always protected, and that health information is appropriately
disposed of once the purpose for which the health information is required
is no longer being served and the retention of the health information is
no longer necessary for legal or business purpose.</p>
<p>o Report cybersecurity incidents and data breaches within the specified
time period (2 hours), and an incident report (within 14 days of initial
notification).</p>
<p>o Note: No need to data breaches involving non-health information, such
as the loss of only financial data or account login details. However, they
may still be required to report such data breaches to PDPC if it meets
the PDPA's data breach notification criteria.</p>
<h2>Outsourcing services to a vendor</h2>
<p>• Examples of vendors e.g., HIMS providers and CS/DS providers.</p>
<p>• Good practices/guidelines when choosing a vendor, e.g.,</p>
<p>o Vendors must fulfil the relevant regulatory requirements</p>
<p>o Ensure the contract signed between the healthcare provider and the vendor
spells out their respective roles and responsibilities.</p>
<p>• Link to the whitelisted HIA NEHR-compatible CMS systems</p>
<p>• Link to the approved CS/DS providers</p>
<h2>Responsibilities of the IT vendor</h2>
<p>• Vendors of health information management systems (e.g. CMS, EMR) providing
their services for the healthcare providers will need to comply with the
cyber and data requirements, in addition to the existing Code of Practice
for Data Portability</p>
<p>• Ensure that the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the health
information are always protected, and that health information is appropriately
disposed of once the purpose for which the health information is required
is no longer being served and the retention of the health information is
no longer necessary for legal or business purpose.</p>
<p>• Support healthcare providers in conducting assessment of cybersecurity
incidents and/or data breaches, and in meeting notification timelines.</p>
<p>• Ensure accurate and complete porting of records between IT vendors as
prescribed, if a healthcare provider chooses to change IT vendors</p>
