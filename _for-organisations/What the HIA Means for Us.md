<h1>Objectives of the Health Information Bill (HIB)</h1>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>HIB will require all licensed healthcare providers, including private
clinics, clinical laboratories and radiological services, to contribute
selected health information to NEHR. These providers will also be granted
access to NEHR to support better care continuity and safeguard patient
welfare.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HIB will also enable and regulate the sharing of non-NEHR individually
identifiable health information within the healthcare ecosystem in support
of national health programmes and initiatives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of health information,
the HIB will set out cybersecurity and data security standards for healthcare
providers and Health Information Management Systems (HIMS).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1>Organisational Roles and Responsibilities</h1>
<h2>Responsibilities of the healthcare provider</h2>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">

</li>
<li>
<p>Report cybersecurity incidents and data breaches within the specified
time period (2 hours), and an incident report (within 14 days of initial

<li>
<p>Ensure that the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the health
