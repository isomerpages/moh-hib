<h2>Cyber and Data Security Guidelines</h2>
<p>This infographic provides an overview of the cyber and data security requirements
while the HIB Cyber and Data Security Guidelines (Dec 2023) for Service
Providers are being revised. The revised requirements will align with CSA’s
Cyber Essentials (15 Apr 2025), with guidance on the handling of physical
copies of health information, and will be published in the first quarter
of 2026.</p>
