# Meaning of "Health Information"
Health information can include items that link you and your health status together. These include personal information, your diagnosis and investigation results, amongst others. If you have enrolled in national initiatives such as Healthier SG, this would include your Health Plan. Such information is useful and relevant for other care providers whom you may visit for care purposes, as part of holistic patient care.
