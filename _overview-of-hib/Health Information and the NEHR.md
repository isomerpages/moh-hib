<h1>What is "Health Information"?</h1><p><strong>"Health Information" refers to any personal information about your health or disability.</strong></p><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><u>Examples of health information include:</u></p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Your prescribed medications</p></li><li><p>Your blood test reports</p></li><li><p>Doctor's notes on your medical condition</p></li><li><p>NRIC and/or age when used with your medical condition</p></li></ul><p></p><p><u>What is not considered health information:</u></p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Your name and NRIC alone</p></li></ul></th></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Some health information exposes a patient to greater harm </strong>during a data breach. These are categorised as Sensitive Health Information, and <strong>additional controls and safeguards</strong> are in place for managing Sensitive Health Information.</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Click here for more information on how the HIB protects your health information.</p></li><li><p>Click <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/resources-statistics/dbn-list-2021" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> for more information on the list of Sensitive Health Information.</p></li></ul><h1>Where will my Health Information be stored?</h1><p>When you visit a healthcare professional, your health information will be recorded in their health record system. Under the HIB, <strong>a selected subset of these information will be contributed and stored in the National Electronic Health Record (NEHR)</strong>. You can also view some of your NEHR records through HealthHub, such as your medications, drug allergies and laboratory results.</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/storage of health information.jpg"></div><h1>National Electronic Health Record (NEHR)</h1><p>The NEHR is the national repository that <strong>collects a subset of your health information</strong> across different healthcare providers. This subset <strong>contains important details about your medical history</strong><a href="#_msocom_2" class="msocomanchor" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"> </a>and is the <strong>minimum set of information that healthcare professionals would generally need to know about you </strong>to deliver care safely.</p><p>For example, drug allergies and prescribed medications are types of health information that will be contributed to the NEHR. There may be occasions where you may not recall the type of medications you are on, and your healthcare professional such as your doctor can access these NEHR records before determining the course of treatment.</p><p><em><u>Mock up of the Patient Dashboard View in NEHR, i.e., what your healthcare professional sees</u></em></p><p></p><h1>What does mandatory contribution to NEHR mean?</h1><p>Since NEHR was introduced in 2011, public healthcare institutions have been contributing selected health information to NEHR, but not all private health institutions have done so. This significantly reduces the usefulness of NEHR as a repository of your medical history and needs.</p><p>The HIB will require all licensed healthcare providers and MOH-approved care providers (such as community pharmacists) to contribute data to the NEHR. In other words,<strong> key selected health information provided when you seek care and treatment from your healthcare provider will be sent and stored in the NEHR</strong>. Over time, your NEHR records will become an increasingly useful tool that a healthcare professional can use when delivering care to you.</p><p>Licensed healthcare providers who do not comply with the mandatory contribution of these selected health information to NEHR may be subject to penalties under the HIB.</p><p>Read on to find out more about NEHR, or <a href="https://www.synapxe.sg/healthtech/national-programmes/national-electronic-health-record-nehr/faq" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">visit their website</a> for more information.</p><p></p>
