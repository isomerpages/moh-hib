<h1>Can I refuse access to or usage of my NEHR records?</h1><p>If you do not want any healthcare professional to access your health record, <strong>you can choose to restrict access to your NEHR records</strong>. Once access is restricted, <strong>healthcare professionals must not access your NEHR records even for care purposes</strong>.</p><p>However, the healthcare professional may <strong>choose to override the access restriction</strong> to provide you with life-saving treatment <strong>during a medical emergency</strong>.</p><p><strong>In such a scenario,</strong> the healthcare professional <strong>must first determine the following</strong>:</p><ol data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Your life is at risk of <u>immediate and significant harm</u> unless medical intervention is provided, and</p></li><li><p>You are <u>unable to provide consent</u> (e.g. in cases of comatose).</p></li></ol><p><strong>The two criteria must be fulfilled</strong> before the healthcare professional can decide to override the access restriction using the Emergency Access Only function. They must also provide a reason for overriding the access restriction.</p><p>The healthcare professional <strong>will not be able to access your NEHR records</strong> if you have the capacity to provide consent and <strong>refuse access despite it being a medical emergency</strong>.</p><p><em><u>Mock up of the Emergency Access Only function, i.e., what your healthcare professional sees</u></em></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/noconsent.png"></div><p><strong>MOH will audit cases where your access restriction is overridden</strong> by the healthcare professional. Healthcare professionals who misuse the Emergency Access Only function may be subject to legal penalties under the HIB and possible further disciplinary action from the respective professional bodies, such as the Singapore Medical Council.</p><h1>What happens after I exercise my restriction rights?</h1><p>While healthcare professionals will be blocked from accessing your NEHR records, the background <strong>contribution of selected health information to NEHR will continue</strong>. This ensures that there will be <strong>no gaps in your NEHR record</strong> if you choose to remove the access restriction in future. &nbsp;</p><p>The ability to place access restrictions on your NEHR records is <strong>intended to uphold your autonomy and privacy</strong>. Hence, once you restrict access to your NEHR records, the following will occur:</p><ol data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p><strong>Access to your NEHR records is restricted for all purposes</strong>, including for patient care, medical examinations, and research purposes;</p></li><li><p>You will <strong>not be able to participate in national programmes</strong> such as HealthierSG, as these programmes require sharing of your health information to be carried out effectively.</p></li></ol><p>However, you can still check the NEHR Access History in HealthHub, and be notified if your NEHR records have been accessed, including through the Emergency Access Only function. While you are unable to view your own information from NEHR via HealthHub today if you have restricted access to NEHR, MOH intends to enhance HealthHub to allow you to monitor and track your own medical care and health plans by being able to view all information (including any Sensitive Health Information) that is drawn from the NEHR within your HealthHub application, even if you had placed access restrictions. Some time will be required for HealthHub to make these changes.</p><p>If you wish to exercise you rights to restrict access, more details on the process are available in <a href="https://www.synapxe.sg/healthtech/national-programmes/national-electronic-health-record-nehr/faq" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">the FAQs by Synapxe</a>.</p><p></p>
