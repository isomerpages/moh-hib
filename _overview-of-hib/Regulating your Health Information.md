# Access to your NEHR records

# Health information beyond your NEHR records may be shared under specific situations

# Data sharing under the HIB is allowed when it fulfills certain criteria

# Anonymised or aggregated health information may be shared

# What if I don't want any healthcare team to access or use my NEHR records?

# What happens after I exercise my access restriction rights?
