<h1>How we prevent improper access and use of your NEHR records</h1><p>Generally, <strong>only authorised healthcare professionals</strong> in a healthcare organisation are allowed to access and use your NEHR records <strong>to provide care</strong> to you. Therefore:</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>A doctor <strong>cannot access your NEHR records for employment or insurance purposes</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Unauthorised personnel in the same organisation, such as admin staff, are not allowed to access your NEHR records.</p></li></ul><h1>Entities can be required to take corrective action</h1><p>The HIB will <strong>empower MOH to instruct healthcare providers to correct any non-compliances</strong>. Corrective actions may include:</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Stop unauthorised access and usage of NEHR records.</p></li><li><p>Destroy all health information collected in an authorised manner.</p></li><li><p>Stop further unauthorised sharing of health information beyond the data-sharing framework under the HIB.</p></li><li><p>Fulfil the cybersecurity and data security requirements.</p></li></ul><h1>NEHR has safeguards to protect against cyber-attacks</h1><p>A comprehensive set of security measures and processes protect the NEHR against cyberattacks. Both system and usersâ€™ access are periodically <strong>subjected to third-party audits</strong> to ensure compliance with security standards for government-owned systems. &nbsp;</p><p>While the HIB will require healthcare organisations to implement systems that can connect to NEHR, a robust onboarding process is in place to ensure such systems have met the appropriate connectivity and security requirements before they are allowed to connect to NEHR.</p><h1>Restricting access to Sensitive Health Information</h1><p>Sensitive Health Information are secured behind two safeguards within NEHR.</p><p>Firstly, <strong>MOH restricts the healthcare professions which can access the Sensitive Health Information</strong>. Not all healthcare professions require such information to carry out their duties.</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>For example, doctors are generally allowed such access as the information may shape the treatment plan for their patients.</p></li><li><p>However, other healthcare professionals, such as physiotherapists, may not require such information to deliver care for their patients, and as such currently do not have access to Sensitive Health Information.</p></li></ul><p>Secondly, for healthcare professionals who are allowed access to the Sensitive Health Information, NEHR has implemented a double log-in mechanism such that healthcare professionals will need to <strong>consciously assess that they require this information </strong>for their care delivery.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/shi.png"></div><p>To further support these user controls, NEHR has also implemented identity management features to notify when an unauthorised access to Sensitive Health Information occurs.</p><p><strong>Access to Sensitive Health Information will be audited</strong>. Healthcare professionals found to have inappropriately accessed or disclosed Sensitive Health Information may be penalised under the HIB or other written laws (e.g., the Infectious Disease Act).</p><h1>Baseline cybersecurity and data security measures</h1><p>Healthcare providers are <strong>required to meet cyber and data security measures</strong> if they:</p><ol data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Have access to NEHR;</p></li><li><p>Need to contribute data to NEHR; OR</p></li><li><p>Participate in data-sharing arrangements allowed under the HIB.</p></li></ol><p>This <strong>ensures the safe and secure handling of health information</strong>. Similar security requirements apply to any third-party vendor that the healthcare provider engages to process health information under the HIB.</p><h1>What if a healthcare organisation outsources their data processing services to a third-party vendor?</h1><h1>What happens when a cybersecurity incident, data breach, or unauthorised access to NEHR occurs?</h1><p></p>
