<h1>How we prevent improper access and use of your NEHR records</h1><p>Generally, <strong>only authorised healthcare professionals</strong> in a healthcare organisation are allowed to access and use your NEHR records <strong>to provide care</strong> to you. Therefore:</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>A doctor <strong>cannot access your NEHR records for employment or insurance purposes</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Unauthorised personnel in the same organisation, such as admin staff, are not allowed to access your NEHR records.</p></li></ul><h1>Entities can be required to take corrective action</h1><p>The HIB will <strong>empower MOH to instruct healthcare providers to correct any non-compliances</strong>. Corrective actions may include:</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Stop unauthorised access and usage of NEHR records.</p></li><li><p>Destroy all health information collected in an authorised manner.</p></li><li><p>Stop further unauthorised sharing of health information beyond the data-sharing framework under the HIB.</p></li><li><p>Fulfil the cybersecurity and data security requirements.</p></li></ul><h1>NEHR has safeguards to protect against cyber-attacks</h1><p>A comprehensive set of security measures and processes protect the NEHR against cyberattacks. Both system and users’ access are periodically <strong>subjected to third-party audits</strong> to ensure compliance with security standards for government-owned systems. &nbsp;</p><p>While the HIB will require healthcare organisations to implement systems that can connect to NEHR, a robust onboarding process is in place to ensure such systems have met the appropriate connectivity and security requirements before they are allowed to connect to NEHR.</p><h1>Restricting access to Sensitive Health Information</h1><p>Sensitive Health Information are secured behind two safeguards within NEHR.</p><p>Firstly, <strong>MOH restricts the healthcare professions which can access the Sensitive Health Information</strong>. Not all healthcare professions require such information to carry out their duties.</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>For example, doctors are generally allowed such access as the information may shape the treatment plan for their patients.</p></li><li><p>However, other healthcare professionals, such as physiotherapists, may not require such information to deliver care for their patients, and as such currently do not have access to Sensitive Health Information.</p></li></ul><p>Secondly, for healthcare professionals who are allowed access to the Sensitive Health Information, NEHR has implemented a double log-in mechanism such that healthcare professionals will need to <strong>consciously assess that they require this information </strong>for their care delivery.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/shi.png"></div><p>To further support these user controls, NEHR has also implemented identity management features to notify when an unauthorised access to Sensitive Health Information occurs.</p><p><strong>Access to Sensitive Health Information will be audited</strong>. Healthcare professionals found to have inappropriately accessed or disclosed Sensitive Health Information may be penalised under the HIB or other written laws (e.g., the Infectious Disease Act).</p><h1>Baseline cybersecurity and data security measures</h1><p>Healthcare providers are <strong>required to meet cyber and data security measures</strong> if they:</p><ol data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Have access to NEHR;</p></li><li><p>Need to contribute data to NEHR; OR</p></li><li><p>Participate in data-sharing arrangements allowed under the HIB.</p></li></ol><p>This <strong>ensures the safe and secure handling of health information</strong>. Similar security requirements apply to any third-party vendor that the healthcare provider engages to process health information under the HIB. More details on the specific security measures can be found in the "<a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/licensing-and-regulation/regulations-guidelines-and-circulars/details/cyber-data-security-guidelines-for-healthcare-providers" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Cyber and Data Security Guidelines for Healthcare Providers</a>".</p><p>MOH will also <strong>conduct random audits</strong> to ensure that healthcare providers have fulfilled the security measures.</p><h1>What happens when a cybersecurity incident, data breach, or unauthorised access to NEHR occurs?</h1><p>The HIB requires healthcare providers to <strong>report cybersecurity incidents, data breaches or unauthorised access to NEHR, to MOH</strong>.</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>An initial report of the confirmed cybersecurity incident, data breach, or unauthorised access to NEHR, must be provided to MOH <strong>within 2 hours</strong>.</p></li><li><p>The detailed incident report must be submitted <strong>after 14 days</strong>.</p></li></ul><p>The mandatory reporting of such incidents enables MOH to <strong>coordinate and respond to incidents that may adversely impact patient safety and privacy</strong>. It also allows MOH to spot patterns that <strong>signal a larger-scale attack </strong>and<strong> pre-emptively take action to protect the integrity</strong> of our healthcare system.</p><p>Healthcare providers are also required to<strong> notify the affected individuals in the event of a notifiable data breach</strong>. Notifiable data breaches refer to:</p><ol data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Data breaches involving Sensitive Health Information; OR</p></li><li><p>Data breaches involving more than 500 individuals*.</p></li></ol><p>The HIB will not require healthcare providers to report data breaches involving non-health information, such as the loss of only financial data or account login details. However, they may still be required to report such data breaches to PDPC if it meets the PDPA's data breach notification criteria.</p><p><em>*The “500 individual” threshold is aligned with PDPA’s data breach notification criteria.</em></p><h1></h1><p></p>
