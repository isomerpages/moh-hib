<h2>Cybersecurity and data security standards</h2>
<p>HIB sets out the cybersecurity and data security standards that will be
imposed on healthcare providers if they contribute to or access NEHR or
share data under the HIB.</p>
<p>This&nbsp;<strong>ensures the safe and secure handling of health information</strong>.
HIMS vendors that support healthcare providers to access or contribute
data to NEHR will also need to meet cybersecurity and data security standards.</p>
<p>MOH will also&nbsp;<strong>conduct audits</strong>&nbsp;to ensure that
healthcare providers have fulfilled the security measures.</p>
<h2>What happens if a healthcare provider encounters a cybersecurity incident or a data breach?</h2>
<p>The HIB will require healthcare providers report<strong> cybersecurity incidents or data breaches to MOH</strong>.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>An initial report of the confirmed cybersecurity incident or data breach
must be provided to MOH&nbsp;<strong>within 2 hours</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The detailed incident report must be submitted&nbsp;<strong>within 14 days</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The mandatory reporting of such incidents enables MOH to&nbsp;<strong>coordinate and respond to incidents that may adversely impact patient safety and privacy</strong>.
It also allows MOH to spot patterns that&nbsp;<strong>signal a larger-scale attack&nbsp;</strong>and<strong>&nbsp;pre-emptively take action to protect the integrity</strong>&nbsp;of
our healthcare system.</p>
<p>Healthcare providers will also be required to<strong>&nbsp;notify the affected individuals in the event of a notifiable data breach that is likely to result in significant harm</strong>.</p>
