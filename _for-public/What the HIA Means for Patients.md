<h2>What the HIA Means for Patients</h2>
<p>• Rapidly ageing population + higher life expectancy = growing healthcare
needs; more chronic diseases requiring sustained care</p>
<p>• Healthcare delivery extends beyond hospitals to clinics, community partners,
caregivers. If care is shifting from hospitals to community, so must other
aspects of healthcare such as patient data, which needs to flow across
different healthcare providers and settings. The Health Information Act
(HIA) is developed to improve the current situation of data collection
and sharing.</p>
<h2>Improving the patient journey through our healthcare ecosystem</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“…better flow of patients’ data drives higher quality of care” – Minister
Ong at World Organisation of Family Doctors Asia Pacific Regional Conference
2024</p>
</blockquote>
<p>• As our population ages, medical conditions become more complex, and
seeing a single doctor (whether public or private) may no longer be enough.</p>
<p>• Patients may need to be referred to various specialists to manage different
medical conditions. Or they may need access to additional services like
health screening, rehabilitation, or physiotherapy.</p>
<p>• Whether patients are seeing their family doctor, a specialist, or a
surgeon for the first time, when healthcare providers can immediately access
patients' medical history, drug allergies, and recent diagnostic images,
they can make better and faster decisions about patients’ treatment.</p>
<p>• To do this, the healthcare system must be able to coordinate across
these different touchpoints seamlessly to deliver a higher quality of care
for patients. This requires patients' health information from previous
visits to be collected, stored, and shared for doctors and healthcare providers.</p>
<h2>One Patient, One Health Record</h2>
<h3>National Electronic Health Record System (NEHR)</h3>
<p>• The NEHR is the national repository that <strong>collects and stores a selected copy of your health information</strong> across
different healthcare providers. This <strong>contains important details about your medical history</strong> that<strong> </strong>healthcare
professionals<strong> would generally need</strong> to make more informed
medical decisions and deliver safe and better care.</p>
<p>For example, drug allergies, laboratory test results and prescribed medications
are types of health information that will be contributed to the NEHR. There
may be occasions where you may not recall the type of medications you are
on, or the tests already done, and your doctor can access the information
in NEHR before determining the course of treatment.</p>
<h3>What does mandatory contribution to NEHR mean? </h3>
<p>The HIB will require all licensed healthcare providers and MOH-approved
care providers (such as retail pharmacies) to contribute data to NEHR.
In other words,<strong> selected health information generated from your care episode with your healthcare provider will be contributed and stored in NEHR</strong>.
This means better care coordination across providers, fewer repeated tests,
and more well-informed medical decisions. Over time, your NEHR will become
an increasingly useful tool for healthcare professionals in delivering
care to you.</p>

<h2>Closing the last mile on achieving a comprehensive overview of patients' medical histories</h2>
<p>• All public healthcare institutions have onboarded the NEHR, with private
hospitals preparing to join. 75% of private primary care clinics are already
connected through Healthier SG.</p>
<p>• NEHR consolidates key health information from various healthcare institutions
through seamless system-to-system integration</p>
<p>o This allows for better care quality, lowers costs and improves patient
safety</p>
<p>• However, while we have achieved good coverage, gaps remain.</p>
<p>o Private specialist clinics, clinical and radiological laboratories,
dental clinics, and retail pharmacies are not yet onboarded.</p>
<p>o HIB closes the last mile through mandatory contribution, ensuring comprehensive
coverage across Singapore's healthcare landscape.</p>
<p>o When fully implemented, most healthcare interactions in Singapore will
contribute to and benefit from the shared health record.</p>

continue to safeguard your health information.</p>
<h2>Support outreach efforts for vulnerable patients in the community</h2>
<p>• Support vulnerable patients/seniors who are isolated in the community.</p>
<p>• Sharing health information enables community care teams to reach out
and identify these seniors before their isolation leads to serious health
crises.</p>
<h2>Key features of the Act</h2>
<p>Explain the three Objectives (in public-friendly terms):</p>
<p>1. Objective 1 provides the legislative basis for (i) mandatory contribution
of selected health information to the NEHR, and (ii) access to the NEHR
for patient care and other specified purposes.</p>
<p>2. Objective 2 enables sharing of identifiable non-NEHR health information
between prescribed entities (e.g., clusters, public agencies) for specified
use cases.</p>
<p>3. Objective 3 sets out the Cybersecurity and Data Security Requirements
imposed on HIA entities1 and providers of Health Information Management
Systems (HIMS)</p>
<p>Provide definition of health information</p>
