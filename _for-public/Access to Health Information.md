<h1>Authorised healthcare professionals may access individuals' health information in NEHR</h1>
<p>NEHR may only be accessed by&nbsp;<strong>authorised healthcare professionals to provide direct patient care for you</strong>.</p>
<p>Other circumstances where your NEHR&nbsp;<strong>may be used&nbsp;</strong>include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>When information from the NEHR is required to be provided under other
written laws.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your healthcare professional does not need to access your NEHR during
every visit. NEHR serves as a complementary tool to aid the healthcare
professional in history taking and physical examination, when making a
clinical assessment.</p>
<p>Healthcare professionals are&nbsp;<strong>not allowed</strong>&nbsp;to
access your NEHR&nbsp;<strong>for employment or insurance purposes</strong>.
Healthcare professionals who are not involved in your care should also
not be accessing your health records.</p>
<h1>How do I know who has accessed NEHR?</h1>
<p>You can view health information such as your medications, drug allergies,
and laboratory results through HealthHub.</p>
<p>The NEHR Access History section in HealthHub allows you to see which healthcare
providers have accessed your health records.</p>
<p>If you suspect that your NEHR has been wrongly accessed,&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://support.healthhub.sg/hc/en-us/articles/15823764203161-NEHR-Access-History-shows-that-my-records-in-the-NEHR-were-accessed-on-a-day-when-I-did-not-seek-any-care-or-treatment-What-should-I-do-" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">you may notify the NEHR system operator, Synapxe, for further investigation</a></strong>.
MOH has implemented robust access controls and set up audit mechanisms
to ensure that appropriate actions are taken against&nbsp;<strong>unauthorised access of your health records</strong>.</p>
