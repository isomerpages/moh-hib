<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>• Rapidly ageing population + higher life expectancy = growing healthcare
needs; more chronic diseases requiring sustained care</p>
<p>• Healthcare delivery extends beyond hospitals to clinics, community partners,
caregivers. If care is shifting from hospitals to community, so must other
aspects of healthcare such as patient data, which needs to flow across
different healthcare providers and settings. The Health Information Act
(HIA) is developed to improve the current situation of data collection
and sharing.</p>
<h2>Improving the patient journey through our healthcare ecosystem</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“…better flow of patients’ data drives higher quality of care” – Minister
Ong at World Organisation of Family Doctors Asia Pacific Regional Conference
2024</p>
</blockquote>
<p>• As our population ages, medical conditions become more complex, and
seeing a single doctor (whether public or private) may no longer be enough.</p>
<p>• Patients may need to be referred to various specialists to manage different
medical conditions. Or they may need access to additional services like
health screening, rehabilitation, or physiotherapy.</p>
<p>• Whether patients are seeing their family doctor, a specialist, or a
surgeon for the first time, when healthcare providers can immediately access
patients' medical history, drug allergies, and recent diagnostic images,
they can make better and faster decisions about patients’ treatment.</p>
<p>• To do this, the healthcare system must be able to coordinate across
these different touchpoints seamlessly to deliver a higher quality of care
for patients. This requires patients' health information from previous
visits to be collected, stored, and shared for doctors and healthcare providers.</p>
<h2>Objectives of the Health Information Bill (HIB)</h2>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>HIB will require all licensed healthcare providers, including private
clinics, clinical laboratories and radiological services, to contribute
selected health information to NEHR. These providers will also be granted
access to NEHR to support better care continuity and safeguard patient
welfare.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HIB will also enable and regulate the sharing of non-NEHR individually
identifiable health information within the healthcare ecosystem in support
of national health programmes and initiatives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of health information,
the HIB will set out cybersecurity and data security standards for healthcare
providers and Health Information Management Systems (HIMS).</p>
</li>
</ol>
