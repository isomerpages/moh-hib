<h2>Can I refuse access to or sharing of my NEHR records?</h2>
<p>If you do not want any healthcare professional to access your health record,&nbsp;<strong>you can choose to restrict access to your NEHR</strong>.
Once access is restricted,&nbsp;<strong>healthcare professionals must not access your NEHR even for care purposes</strong>.
You can already restrict such access to NEHR today by opting out of sharing
through the NEHR.</p>
<p>Under the proposed HIB in future, MOH will refine the access restriction
regime to enable greater autonomy and enhance patient safety:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will enable patients to
select the healthcare providers who can access their NEHR information</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A basic set of health information
(i.e. allergies, vaccination records, together with key demographic information
i.e. name, NRIC or FIN, date of birth, race and gender) will remain accessible
to healthcare providers even if an access restriction is in place. These
are essential health information for patient safety purposes and will be
available to the attending medical team to ensure safe care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the event of a medical emergency
that threatens the life or health of the patient, healthcare providers
may override access restrictions. This enhances speed and quality of care,
which is critical during medical emergencies. It is also a feature in jurisdictions
such as Finland, Australia and Hong Kong which have national health repositories
similar to NEHR. &nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The enhanced access controls will be made available on the HealthHub application
in the second half of 2026.</p>
<p>MOH will audit cases where your access restriction is overridden&nbsp;by
the healthcare professional. Healthcare professionals who inappropriately
override access restrictions to NEHR may be subject to legal penalties
under the HIB and disciplinary action from the respective professional
bodies, such as the Singapore Medical Council.</p>
<h2>What happens after I exercise my access restriction rights?</h2>
<p>If you restrict access to your NEHR, your doctor will not be able to access
them, even to provide care to you.</p>
<p>While healthcare professionals will be blocked from accessing your NEHR,
the background&nbsp;contribution of selected health information to NEHR
will continue. This ensures that there will be&nbsp;no gaps in your NEHR&nbsp;if
you choose to remove the access restriction in future.</p>
<p>Additionally, this ensures that you will receive appropriate care during
emergency situations when there is a need to override the restrictions.</p>
<p>Today, you can already check the NEHR Access History in HealthHub, to
see if your NEHR have been accessed.</p>
<p>If you wish to restrict access, more details on the opt-out process is
available in the <strong><a href="https://www.synapxe.sg/healthtech/national-programmes/national-electronic-health-record-nehr/faq" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">FAQs by Synapxe</a></strong>
</p>
<h2>I’ve changed my mind and want to remove the access restriction</h2>
<p>• Can opt back in via HealthHub</p>
