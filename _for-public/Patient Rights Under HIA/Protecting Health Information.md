<h2>NEHR has safeguards to protect against cyber-attacks</h2>
<p>A comprehensive set of security measures and processes protect the NEHR
against cyberattacks. On top of that, both system operator‘s and users’
access are <strong>regularly audited and subjected to vulnerability scans and penetration tests </strong>to
ensure strict compliance with security standards for government-owned systems.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, systems that are required to connect to NEHR undergo a robust
onboarding process to ensure that they have met the appropriate connectivity
and security requirements before they are allowed to connect to NEHR.</p>
<h2>How MOH prevents improper access and use of your NEHR records</h2>
<p>The HIB also has safeguards in place to govern the safe access, collection
and use of NEHR information. These safeguards include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Penalties to deter unauthorised
or improper access of NEHR information</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Healthcare providers and their authorised personnel</strong>&nbsp;may
only access the NEHR information of patients registered with them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only personnel directly involved
in patient care are granted NEHR access. Healthcare providers are also
required to update NEHR when the roles of their authorised personnel change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Accessing NEHR information for employment or insurance purposes, will be disallowed</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>MOH will also be able to direct healthcare providers and their authorised
personnel to take corrective actions such as stopping unauthorised access
and use of NEHR, and destroying health information collected in an unauthorised
manner.</p>
<h2>What happens when a cybersecurity incident, data breach or unauthorised access to NEHR occurs?</h2>
<p>The HIB will require healthcare providers report<strong> cybersecurity incidents or data breaches to MOH</strong>.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>An initial report of the confirmed cybersecurity incident or data breach
must be provided to MOH&nbsp;<strong>within 2 hours</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The detailed incident report must be submitted&nbsp;<strong>within 14 days</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The mandatory reporting of such incidents enables MOH to&nbsp;<strong>coordinate and respond to incidents that may adversely impact patient safety and privacy</strong>.
It also allows MOH to spot patterns that&nbsp;<strong>signal a larger-scale attack&nbsp;</strong>and<strong>&nbsp;pre-emptively take action to protect the integrity</strong>&nbsp;of
our healthcare system.</p>
<p>Healthcare providers will also be required to<strong>&nbsp;notify the affected individuals in the event of a notifiable data breach that is likely to result in significant harm</strong>.</p>
