<h2>Authorised healthcare professionals may access your NEHR records</h2>
<p>• Access to NEHR records only for the provision of healthcare service
and community health service</p>
<p>• Summary of the types of users who can access NEHR</p>
<p>• Access to NEHR records not allowed for</p>
<p>o Any employment purpose (except for statutory medical examinations prescribed
under the HIA); or</p>
<p>o Assessment of insurability.</p>
<p>• MOH has developed a set of guidelines to guide healthcare professionals
on the appropriate use and access to NEHR records.</p>
<p>• MOH has also built in technical controls such as session timeout after
a period of inactivity, and controls to limit patient search.</p>
<p>• Regular backend audits are performed to flag inappropriate accesses
for review and dormant accounts will be removed.</p>
<h2>How do I check who has assessed my NEHR records?</h2>
<p>• Patients can check which institutions/clinics has viewed their NEHR
records via access logs on Health Hub.</p>
<p>• If unauthorised access to NEHR is suspected, write to <a href="mailto:nehr.feedback@synapxe.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">nehr.feedback@synapxe.sg</a>.</p>
<h2>Can I refuse access to or sharing of my NEHR records?</h2>
<p>• Individuals can (i) select which NEHR Users (e.g. institutions, clinics,
pharmacies, etc) can access their NEHR information; or (ii) block access
to all NEHR Users.</p>
<p>• The opt-out will apply only to Users who are accessing the NEHR for
the purpose of patient care.</p>
<h2>What happens after I exercise my access restriction rights?</h2>
<p>• Even if an individual has opted-out:</p>
<p>o A basic set of essential information will be viewable by all NEHR Users,
to minimise impact to care. These are allergies and vaccinations records
(together with key demographic information).</p>
<p>o All their data can be accessed in a life-and-death medical emergency
(“Break glass”).</p>
<p>o Contribution of health information to NEHR is required even if an individual
has opted out. This ensures that there are no gaps in their NEHR record
should they choose to opt back in later.</p>
<p>• Sharing of opted out NEHR information will be allowed under the following
circumstances:</p>
<p>o Where required or permitted by other written law (e.g. the PSGA or CPC).</p>
<p>o Where requested on public health grounds and approved for sharing by
the Minister for Health or his delegated authorised officer.</p>
<h2>I’ve changed my mind and want to remove the access restriction</h2>
<p>• Can opt back in via HealthHub</p>
<h2>Health information outside of the NEHR may be shared to facilitate your care and coordination</h2>
<p>• Strategic shift from hospital to community to support ageing population
and to reduce burden on acute care healthcare providers.</p>
<p>• Data sharing facilitates shared care and coordination across between
hospitals, clinics, community partners and caregivers</p>
<p>• Example (if any)</p>
<h2>Specific provisions are in place to facilitate data sharing</h2>
<p>1. Data sharing is only permitted for specified purposes</p>
<p>2. Only for prescribed entities</p>
<p>3. A valid Data Sharing Agreement must be signed between the discloser
and recipient</p>
<h2>Sharing of anonymised or aggregated data</h2>
<p>• Goal of data sharing, i.e., to perform data analysis and obtain findings
or insights that helps to develop better policies or medical treatments.</p>
<p>• MOH may impose conditions before the disclosure can take place. These
include prohibiting the entities from re-identifying the individuals from
the dataset.</p>
<h2>NEHR has safeguards to protect against cyber-attacks</h2>
<p>• Third-party audits to ensure compliance with security standards for
government-owned systems.</p>
<p>• Robust onboarding process to ensure systems used by healthcare providers
have met the appropriate connectivity and security requirements before
they are allowed to connect to NEHR.</p>
<h2>How MOH prevents improper access and use of your NEHR records</h2>
<p>• There are built-in technical controls such as session timeout after
a period of inactivity, and controls to limit patient search.</p>
<p>• Regular backend audits are performed to flag inappropriate accesses
for review.</p>
<p>• System Operator will conduct User Account Review periodically to remove
dormant accounts and ensure access granted are based on current business
needs.</p>
<p>• Patients can check which institutions/clinics has viewed their NEHR
records via access logs on Health Hub.</p>
<h2>What happens when a cybersecurity incident, data breach or unauthorised access to NEHR occurs?</h2>
<p>• Healthcare providers must report cybersecurity incidents or data breaches
to MOH.</p>
<p>o An initial report of the confirmed cybersecurity incident or data breach
must be provided to MOH within 2 hours.</p>
<p>o The detailed incident report must be submitted after 14 days.</p>
<p>• Healthcare providers are also required to notify the affected individuals
in the event of a notifiable data breach. Notifiable data breaches refer
to data breaches involving more than 500 individuals.</p>
<h2>Organisations must comply with baseline cybersecurity and data security measures</h2>
<p>• Healthcare providers as well as their IT vendors supporting connection
to NEHR must</p>
<p>o Meet cybersecurity and data security requirements for IT systems and
medical devices</p>
<p>o Report confirmed cybersecurity incidents and data breaches to MOH and
affected individuals in a timely manner</p>
<p>• Strict penalties will be imposed for any contraventions to the HIA requirements</p>
<h2>Organisations can be required to take corrective action</h2>
<p>• To minimise harm arising from non-compliances, MOH can direct contributors
to contribute health information in accordance with the Act, stop users
from accessing or collecting health information or require users to delete
health information in their possession.</p>
<p>o Failure to comply with a MOH Direction will result in an offence.</p>
<p>• Strict penalties will apply to any authorised persons’ unauthorised
access, collection or use of NEHR information. There will also be enhanced
penalties in place to serve as a deterrent in certain scenarios:</p>
<p>o Repeat offences carry penalties that are 2x higher than the first offence;</p>
<p>o Access or collection of NEHR information for prohibited purposes (i.e.,
for any employment or insurance purpose) will be subject to penalties that
2x higher;</p>
<p>o Unauthorised individuals who access or use of NEHR information will
face penalties that are 2x higher, as these individuals were never allowed
access to NEHR in the first place.</p>
<p>• In the event of non-compliance or breach of HIA requirements, MOH has
the power to direct the System Operator to take a range of actions with
immediate effect to prevent or minimise harm to individuals arising from
the non-compliance/ breach. For example, the System Operator may limit
the data types that an user may access, suspend or remove an users’ access
to NEHR.</p>
<p>• Min(H) may tap on emergency powers and direct healthcare providers to
perform non-cyber mitigating measures to respond to threats and incidents
affecting health information</p>
