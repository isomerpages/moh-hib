<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>With Singapore's rapidly ageing population and higher life expectancy,
healthcare needs will continue growing and there will be more chronic diseases
requiring sustained care.</p>
<p>Healthcare delivery extends beyond hospitals to clinics, community partners,
caregivers. If care is shifting from hospitals to community, so must other
aspects of healthcare such as patient data, which needs to flow across
different healthcare providers and settings. The Health Information Act
(HIA) is developed to improve the current situation of data collection
and sharing.</p>
<h2>Improving the patient journey through our healthcare ecosystem</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“…better flow of patients’ data drives higher quality of care” – Minister
Ong at World Organisation of Family Doctors Asia Pacific Regional Conference
2024</p>

<p>As our population ages, medical conditions become more complex, and seeing
a single doctor (whether public or private) may no longer be enough.</p>
<p>Patients may need to be referred to various specialists to manage different
medical conditions. Or they may need access to additional services like
health screening, rehabilitation, or physiotherapy.</p>
<p>Whether patients are seeing their family doctor, a specialist, or a surgeon
for the first time, when healthcare providers can immediately access patients'
medical history, drug allergies, and recent diagnostic images, they can
make better and faster decisions about patients’ treatment.</p>
<p>To do this, the healthcare system must be able to coordinate across these
different touchpoints seamlessly to deliver a higher quality of care for
patients. This requires patients' health information from previous visits
to be collected, stored, and shared for doctors and healthcare providers.</p>
