---
<h2><em>Introduction</em></h2>
<p><em>With Singapore's rapidly ageing population and higher life expectancy, healthcare needs will continue growing and there will be more chronic diseases requiring sustained care.</em>
</p>
<p><em>Healthcare delivery extends beyond hospitals to clinics, community partners, caregivers. If care is shifting from hospitals to community, so must other aspects of healthcare such as patient data, which needs to flow across different healthcare providers and settings. The Health Information Act (HIA) is developed to improve the current situation of data collection and sharing.</em>
</p>
<h2><em>Improving the patient journey through our healthcare ecosystem</em></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“…better flow of patients’ data drives higher quality of care” – Minister Ong at World Organisation of Family Doctors Asia Pacific Regional Conference 2024</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>As our population ages, medical conditions become more complex, and seeing a single doctor (whether public or private) may no longer be enough.</em>
</p>
<p><em>Patients may need to be referred to various specialists to manage different medical conditions. Or they may need access to additional services like health screening, rehabilitation, or physiotherapy.</em>
</p>
<p><em>Whether patients are seeing their family doctor, a specialist, or a surgeon for the first time, when healthcare providers can immediately access patients' medical history, drug allergies, and recent diagnostic images, they can make better and faster decisions about patients’ treatment.</em>
</p>
<p><em>To do this, the healthcare system must be able to coordinate across these different touchpoints seamlessly to deliver a higher quality of care for patients. This requires patients' health information from previous visits to be collected, stored, and shared for doctors and healthcare providers.</em>
</p>
<h2><em>Support outreach efforts for vulnerable patients in the community</em></h2>
<p><em>• Support vulnerable patients/seniors who are isolated in the community.</em>
</p>
<p><em>• Sharing health information enables community care teams to reach out and identify these seniors before their isolation leads to serious health crises.</em>
