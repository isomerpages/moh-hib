<h2>What is "Health Information"?</h2>
<p>Health information includes:</p>
<p><strong>Personal details</strong> - This refers to information like your
name, address, phone number, and other personal details. This counts as
health information when it is used for healthcare purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Medical details</strong> - This refers to information about your
physical and mental health, as well as details about your diagnosis, treatment,
and care. Examples include your prescriptions, test results, medical procedures,
and discharge notes when you leave the hospital.</p>
<h2>Where will health information be stored?</h2>
<p>When you visit a healthcare service, health information generated during
that visit will be recorded in their health record systems. Under the HIB,&nbsp;<strong>a subset of these information will be contributed and stored in the National Electronic Health Record system (NEHR)</strong>.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>National Electronic Health Record System (NEHR)</h2>
<p>The NEHR is the national repository that <strong>collects and stores a selected copy of your health information</strong> across
different healthcare providers. This <strong>contains important details about your medical history</strong> that<strong> </strong>healthcare
professionals<strong> would generally need</strong> to make more informed
medical decisions and deliver safe and better care.</p>
<p>For example, drug allergies, laboratory test results and prescribed medications
are types of health information that will be contributed to the NEHR. There
may be occasions where you may not recall the type of medications you are
on, or the tests already done, and your doctor can access the information
in NEHR before determining the course of treatment.</p>
<h2>What does mandatory contribution to NEHR mean?</h2>
<p>The HIB will require all licensed healthcare providers and MOH-approved
care providers (such as retail pharmacies) to contribute data to NEHR.
In other words,<strong> selected health information generated from your care episode with your healthcare provider will be contributed and stored in NEHR</strong>.
This means better care coordination across providers, fewer repeated tests,
and more well-informed medical decisions. Over time, your NEHR will become
an increasingly useful tool for healthcare professionals in delivering
care to you.</p>

<h2><em>Closing the last mile on achieving a comprehensive overview of patients' medical histories</em></h2>
<p><em>All public healthcare institutions have onboarded the NEHR, with private hospitals preparing to join. 75% of private primary care clinics are already connected through Healthier SG.</em>
</p>
<p><em>NEHR consolidates key health information from various healthcare institutions through seamless system-to-system integration. This allows for better care quality, lowers costs and improves patient safety.</em>
</p>
<p><em>However, while we have achieved good coverage, gaps remain. Private specialist clinics, clinical and radiological laboratories, dental clinics, and retail pharmacies are not yet onboarded.</em>
</p>
<p><em>HIB closes the last mile through mandatory contribution, ensuring comprehensive coverage across Singapore's healthcare landscape. When fully implemented, most healthcare interactions in Singapore will contribute to and benefit from the shared health record.</em>
</p>
<p><em>Read on to learn more about what this means for you, and how MOH will continue to safeguard your health information.</em>
