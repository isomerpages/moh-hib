<h2>Can I refuse access to or sharing of my NEHR records?</h2>
<p>• Individuals can (i) select which NEHR Users (e.g. institutions, clinics,
pharmacies, etc) can access their NEHR information; or (ii) block access
to all NEHR Users.</p>
<p>• The opt-out will apply only to Users who are accessing the NEHR for
the purpose of patient care.</p>
<h2>What happens after I exercise my access restriction rights?</h2>
<p>• Even if an individual has opted-out:</p>
<p>o A basic set of essential information will be viewable by all NEHR Users,
to minimise impact to care. These are allergies and vaccinations records
(together with key demographic information).</p>
<p>o All their data can be accessed in a life-and-death medical emergency
(“Break glass”).</p>
<p>o Contribution of health information to NEHR is required even if an individual
has opted out. This ensures that there are no gaps in their NEHR record
should they choose to opt back in later.</p>
<p>• Sharing of opted out NEHR information will be allowed under the following
circumstances:</p>
<p>o Where required or permitted by other written law (e.g. the PSGA or CPC).</p>
<p>o Where requested on public health grounds and approved for sharing by
the Minister for Health or his delegated authorised officer.</p>
<h2>I’ve changed my mind and want to remove the access restriction</h2>
<p>• Can opt back in via HealthHub</p>
<h2>Health information outside of the NEHR may be shared to facilitate your care and coordination</h2>
<p>• Strategic shift from hospital to community to support ageing population
and to reduce burden on acute care healthcare providers.</p>
<p>• Data sharing facilitates shared care and coordination across between
hospitals, clinics, community partners and caregivers</p>
<p>• Example (if any)</p>
