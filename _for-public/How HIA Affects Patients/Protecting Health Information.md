<h2>NEHR has safeguards to protect against cyber-attacks</h2>
<p>A comprehensive set of security measures and processes protect the NEHR
against cyberattacks. On top of that, both system operator‘s and users’
access are <strong>regularly audited and subjected to vulnerability scans and penetration tests </strong>to
ensure strict compliance with security standards for government-owned systems.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, systems that are required to connect to NEHR undergo a robust
onboarding process to ensure that they have met the appropriate connectivity
and security requirements before they are allowed to connect to NEHR.</p>
<h2>How MOH prevents improper access and use of your NEHR records</h2>
<p>The HIB also has safeguards in place to govern the safe access, collection
and use of NEHR information. These safeguards include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Penalties to deter unauthorised
or improper access of NEHR information</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Healthcare providers and their authorised personnel</strong>&nbsp;may
only access the NEHR information of patients registered with them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only personnel directly involved
in patient care are granted NEHR access. Healthcare providers are also
required to update NEHR when the roles of their authorised personnel change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Accessing NEHR information for employment or insurance purposes, will be disallowed</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>MOH will also be able to direct healthcare providers and their authorised
personnel to take corrective actions such as stopping unauthorised access
and use of NEHR, and destroying health information collected in an unauthorised
manner.</p>
<h2>What happens when a cybersecurity incident, data breach or unauthorised access to NEHR occurs?</h2>
<p>The HIB will require healthcare providers report<strong> cybersecurity incidents or data breaches to MOH</strong>.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>An initial report of the confirmed cybersecurity incident or data breach
must be provided to MOH&nbsp;<strong>within 2 hours</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The detailed incident report must be submitted&nbsp;<strong>within 14 days</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The mandatory reporting of such incidents enables MOH to&nbsp;<strong>coordinate and respond to incidents that may adversely impact patient safety and privacy</strong>.
It also allows MOH to spot patterns that&nbsp;<strong>signal a larger-scale attack&nbsp;</strong>and<strong>&nbsp;pre-emptively take action to protect the integrity</strong>&nbsp;of
our healthcare system.</p>
<p>Healthcare providers will also be required to<strong>&nbsp;notify the affected individuals in the event of a notifiable data breach that is likely to result in significant harm</strong>.</p>
<h2>Organisations must comply with baseline cybersecurity and data security measures</h2>
<p>• Healthcare providers as well as their IT vendors supporting connection
to NEHR must</p>
<p>o Meet cybersecurity and data security requirements for IT systems and
medical devices</p>
<p>o Report confirmed cybersecurity incidents and data breaches to MOH and
affected individuals in a timely manner</p>
<p>• Strict penalties will be imposed for any contraventions to the HIA requirements</p>
<h2>Organisations can be required to take corrective action</h2>
<p>• To minimise harm arising from non-compliances, MOH can direct contributors
to contribute health information in accordance with the Act, stop users
from accessing or collecting health information or require users to delete
health information in their possession.</p>
<p>o Failure to comply with a MOH Direction will result in an offence.</p>
<p>• Strict penalties will apply to any authorised persons’ unauthorised
access, collection or use of NEHR information. There will also be enhanced
penalties in place to serve as a deterrent in certain scenarios:</p>
<p>o Repeat offences carry penalties that are 2x higher than the first offence;</p>
<p>o Access or collection of NEHR information for prohibited purposes (i.e.,
for any employment or insurance purpose) will be subject to penalties that
2x higher;</p>
<p>o Unauthorised individuals’ who access or use of NEHR information will
face penalties that are 2x higher, as these individuals were never allowed
access to NEHR in the first place.</p>
<p>• In the event of non-compliance or breach of HIA requirements, MOH has
the power to direct the System Operator to take a range of actions with
immediate effect to prevent or minimise harm to individuals arising from
the non-compliance/ breach. For example, the System Operator may limit
the data types that an user may access, suspend or remove an users’ access
to NEHR.</p>
<p>• Min(H) may tap on emergency powers and direct healthcare providers to
perform non-cyber mitigating measures to respond to threats and incidents
affecting health information</p>
